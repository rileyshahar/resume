## Projects

### [**aga**](https://github.com/nihilistkitten/aga) | python, CLI development, library design

Library for easy development of CS assignment autograders

- Started work on own time and initiative; now paid to develop for Reed College intro CS
- Designed & implemented user-friendly, pythonic, decorator-heavy API and strongly-typed CLI
- Utilizing modern devops tools/CI pipeline for testing, code formatting, and documentation generation

### [**cache-sim**](https://github.com/nihilistkitten/cache-sim) | rust, algorithms, research

Research cache simulator for experimental evaluation of cache algorithms

- Actively in use for multiple ongoing research projects at Reed
- Used polymorphism to implement generic library for different caching models
- Optimized to run on datasets with billions of accesses

### [**botcbot**](https://github.com/nihilistkitten/botcbot) | python, concurrency, OOP

Asynchronous Discord bot for running the board game Blood on the Clocktower

- Implemented safe concurrent management of gamestate with simultaneous networked player actions
- Used object-oriented paradigm to allow easy extensibility with new game content
- Moved recent development to a private repo due to playtesting private IP with game's developers

### [**puzzles**](https://github.com/nihilistkitten/aga) | rust, algorithms, optimization, library design

Rust solutions to various Advent of Code and Project Euler programming puzzles

- Optimized each solution to under 1sec runtime; most under 1ms
- Extracted core algorithms like prime generation and graph traversal to shared library with polymorphic API

### [**dotfiles**](https://github.com/nihilistkitten/dotfiles) | bash, lua, linux, git

Configuration files for daily use on Arch Linux

- Wrote hundreds of lines of Bash scripts for automating daily workflow
- Implemented fast, dynamic [custom statusline](https://nihilistkitten.me/nvim-lua-statusline/) for Neovim in Lua
